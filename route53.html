    <p>Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service.</p>
    
    <h2>Routing Policies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Simple Routing Policy</b> - Simple routing lets you configure standard DNS records, with no special Route 53 routing such as weighted or latency. With simple routing, you typically route traffic to a single resource, for example, to a web server for your website.</li>
        <li><b>Failover Routing Policy</b> - Failover routing lets you route traffic to a resource when the resource is healthy or to a different resource when the first resource is unhealthy.</li>
        <li><b>Geolocation routing Policy</b> - Geolocation routing lets you choose the resources that serve your traffic based on the geographic location of your users, meaning the location that DNS queries originate from. For example, you might want all queries from Europe to be routed to an ELB load balancer in the Frankfurt region.</li>
        <li><b>Geoproximity routing policy (Traffic flow only)</b> - Geoproximity routing lets Amazon Route 53 route traffic to your resources based on the geographic location of your users and your resources. You can also optionally choose to route more traffic or less to a given resource by specifying a value, known as a bias. A bias expands or shrinks the size of the geographic region from which traffic is routed to a resource.</li>
        <li><b>Latency Routing Policy</b> - If your application is hosted in multiple AWS Regions, you can improve performance for your users by serving their requests from the AWS Region that provides the lowest latency.</li>
        <li><b>Multivalue Answer Routing Policy</b> - Multivalue answer routing lets you configure Amazon Route 53 to return multiple values, such as IP addresses for your web servers, in response to DNS queries. You</li>
        <li><b>Weighted Routing Policy</b> - Weighted routing lets you associate multiple resources with a single domain name (example.com) or subdomain name (acme.example.com) and choose how much traffic is routed to each resource.</li>
    </ul>
